# Before Start

- Open Offenthaler et al and the exponential equation

- Maybe open the plot which separates the 2D space into two areas
  
# Beginning:
  
- Dont be scared about the number of slides, I am scared and this is enough

- Ill try to make it brief and the reason acually is that I do no know how to make proper transitions
in this progam. So in Powerpoint this maybe would have been 40 or somehting


# What is a rainfall threshold?

- THe important take away is that it is a value (in 1D) or a line (in 2D) where the state of a system changes abruptly
- There is  of literature about the existence of actual physical geomorphologic thresholds. WHich is actually super interesting, however not part of the thesis...


# Felix rainfall data

- Object based, not pixel based

- Support Vector Regression/ Support Vector machine for regression and not classifying problems

# RMSE


- All we are seeing here are rainfall events and landslide at the same time
# Uncommon in binary classification problems

- If you wanna predict if a person has diabetes

- You do not look only at persons having diabetes, take their blood pressure and Age and fit a line
