# Beginning:
  
- Dont be scared about the number of slides, I am scared and this is enough

- Ill try to make it brief and the reason acually is that I do no know how to make proper transitions
in this progam. So in Powerpoint this maybe would have been 40 or somehting


# What is a rainfall threshold?

- THe important take away is that it is a value (in 1D) or a line (in 2D) where the state of a system changes abruptly
- There is  of literature about the existence of actual physical geomorphologic thresholds. WHich is actually super interesting, however not part of the thesis...
