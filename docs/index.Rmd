# The internship

- Started in December 2020 and was prolonged in April 2021 (when I also officially started the master's thesis)

- Embedded in the Proslide Project

- Combination of static and dynamic for the analysis and prediction of shallow landslides

  - Subgoal: Develop rainfall thresholds for the Province of South Tyrol 

- I'll show some of the interesting aspects from this process

# What is a rainfall threshold?

.cite[A threshold is the minimum or maximum level of some quantity needed for a process to take place or a state to change (White et al, 1996). A minimum threshold defines the lowest level below which a process does not occur. A maximum threshold represents the level above which a process always occurs. For rainfall-induced landslides a threshold may define the rainfall, soil moisture, or hydrological conditions that, when reached or exceeded, are likely to trigger landslides.]

# Anatomy of a threshold:

### Data:
  + Rainfall/Soil moisture/... data
  + Landslide data

### Some quantity to reach/exceed:
 + Event-Intenstiy (I), -Duration (D), -Cumulated rainfall (E) 
 + 3-day cumulated rainfall before slide (p3)
 + 15-day cumulated rainfall before slide (p15)

### A threshold-model to represent reality:
  - A value (1D threshold) 
  - A line (2D threshold) 
  - A probability value (something else)

---

# Data

### Gridded rainfall data

- 250 m spatial resolution / 1 day temporal resolution
- Available for the regions of South Tyrol and Trento as NetCDFs
- Anomaly-based approach / Kriging?

# Threshold model

## Quantile regression

  - For *deterministic* thresholds
  - More in just a second

***

## Binary classifiers
   - **Logistic regression**
      + Linear (the logit of the estimated probability) 
      + Interpretable (Yet not like OLS)
      
   - **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**
      + Semi-parametric extension of GLMs
      + Can capture non-linearities by using e.g. splines 
      + Due to additive structure, still some interpretation possible

# Primer on Quantile Regression

<br> 

- Introduced by `r Citet(myBib, "Koenker_1978")`

- Implemented in R in the `quantreg` package `r Citep(myBib, "Koenker_2020")`

- Fits conditional quantiles, rather than the conditional mean (OLS)

- Minimizes the sum of asymmetrically weighted residuals

- More robust against outliers in the response than OLS

- Can handle skewed error distributions better than OLS

- Standard errors are somwehat less straightforward to calculate

--

## - Thus, it leaves roughly 5 % of the data below the line (when the 5 % quantile is fitted)

.small2[
- <span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 160%'> <u> Question: </u> How long does it take for the soil to dry? </span>

- detailed physical knowledge of landslide location necessary

  - Evapotranspiration, Aspect, Slope, soil porosity, permeability, rainfall infiltration, ...

- "The practical background of ID is that [...] it .purple[could be] that precipitation information is a good proxy for both meteorological trigger and hydro- logical cause. Although applied in many case studies, this approach suffers from many false positives as well as .purple[limited physical process understanding]" `r Citep(myBib, "Bogaard_2018")`

- "[...] antecedent soil moisture conditions may provide .purple[critical support] for the correct definition of the triggering conditions." `r Citep(myBib, "Lazarri_2020")`

- "3-day recent rainfall and 15-day antecedent rainfall variables [12,20], are .purple[significantly improved] by merely replacing antecedent rainfall with average .purple[soil saturation measured over the same interval] `r Citep(myBib, "Mirus_2018")`
]

## 3-15 day 5 % non-exceedance probability antecedent thresholds

- 3 day precipitation prior to landslide (p3)

- 15 day precipitation prior to p3 (p15)

- Fit a 5 % non-exceedance probability threshold using quantile regression

- No need for defining "rainfall events"

- But where does the decision for the 3 and 15 days come from?

- Look at `r Citep(myBib, map_chr(c("_2000", "_2006", "_2008"), ~paste0("Chleborad", .x)))`

- Intuitive (mostly)

# Validation!

## Is it good? Is it bad? Is it somewhere in the middle?

- We need reference (as in real life)

- Validation is (maybe) the most important research frontier for rainfall thresholds

- But it is very complicated as local characteristics will always be different

- It is even more different if one a priori "defines" the missclassification rate

- For the moment being we only have false negatives (missed alarms)

- We define (and accept) there to be 5 % of missed alarms

---

# How to validate a threshold like this?

## I decided that 5 % the data should stay below the threshold

## So a good threshold will have 5 % of new, unseen, data below the threshold?

## Generalization vs Precision...!!

  + The smaller the scale is the better the incorporation of local characteristics. Yet, the lower its generalization capabilities
  
  + How can we maybe know out if it ok to use one threshold for entire South Tyrol?
  
  + Distance from false negatives to threshold in a (spatial) cross validation (not really... More a spatial partitioning)

## What is again the main goal of a threshold?

--

## "separate the storms that lead to shallow landsliding from those that do not" `r Citep(myBib, "Jakob_2003")`

--
  
- Unusual in other common binary classification problems

- The model has no information whatsoever how rainfall events look like that (probably) did not cause landslides

- Probability to the rescue: "When different outputs (landslide or no-landslide) can be obtained for the same input a probabilistic approach is preferable" `r Citep(myBib, "Berti_2012")`

# Results

- We rarely know anything why a landslide really was triggered

- We can't obtain the exact rainfall at the landslide location

- Simple, deterministic, thresholds are easy to setup, but depend critically on (arbitratry decision) not coming from the data itself 

- Deterministic thresholds are complicated to validate (What is a good deterministic threshold after all?)

- Probabilistic thresholds seem to be a more statistically sound approach

- Performance of binary classifiers is (surprisingly?) good

- Combination of susceptibility (spatial perspective) and rainfall thresholds (temporal perspective)

- Future: Satellite data and probabilistic, Bayesian, rainfall thresholds

# Take away

##- With hindsight many things I would have done differently

##- Still appealing: Bayesian approach as in Berti et al. 2012 in combination with landslide susceptibility

##- Do less, in more depth rather than more, shallow

##- Needless to say, but: Do not implement this in any LEWS!
