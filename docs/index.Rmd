# Quick introduction

-  My name is Robin Kohrs

--

- I am from Hamburg, where I also mainly did my masters.

--

- At some point I changed my masters from geography in Innsbruck to to geoinformatics in Jena

--

- I really like (spatial) statistics, remote sensing, data-handling, and data visualization (although I'm no good in any of them)
 
---

# The internship

- Started in December 2020 and was prolonged in April 2021 (when I also officially started the master thesis)

<br>
- Embedded in the Proslide project

<br>
- Develop rainfall thresholds for the Province of South Tyrol 

<br>
- Do a final presentation

# What is a rainfall threshold?

.cite[A threshold is the minimum or maximum level of some quantity needed for a process to take place or a state to change (White et al, 1996). A minimum threshold defines the lowest level below which a process does not occur. A maximum threshold represents the level above which a process always occurs. For rainfall-induced landslides a threshold may define the rainfall, soil moisture, or hydrological conditions that, when reached or exceeded, are likely to trigger landslides.]

# Anatomy of a threshold:

### Data
  + Rainfall/Soil moisture/... data
  + Landslide data

### Some quantity to reach/exceed:
 + Event-Intenstiy (I), -Duration (D), -Cumulated rainfall (E) 
 + 3-day cumualted rainfall before slide (p3)
 + 15-day cumualted rainfall before slide (p15)

### A threshold-model to represent reality:
  - A value (1D threshold) 
  - A line (2D threshold) 
  - A probability value (something else)

---

# Data

### Gridded rainfall data

- 250 m spatial resolution / 1 day temporal resolution
- Available for the regions of South Tyrol and Trento as NetCDFs
- Anomaly-based approach / Kriging?
- `r Citet(myBib, "Crespi_2021")`

--

### Landslide Data

- Inventario dei fenomeni franosi in Italia (IFFI) Database
- Gravitational movemets of all types (no avalanches)
- Many variables (including the date, material, extent, ...)
- I received a manual extraction of the database:
  * Ms Access Database
  * Excel FIles
  * Shapefiles

# Methods for thresholding

## Quantile regression
  - For *deterministic* threshold
  - More in just a second

<br>
***

## Binary classifiers
   - **Logistic regression**
      + Linear 
      + Interpretable (yet not OLS)
      
   - **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**
      + Semi-parametric extension of GLMs
      + Can capture non-linearities by using e.g. splines 
      + Due to additive structure, still some interpretation possible

##1. What do we see on the two axes

--

##2. How do we fit the line

--

##3. Is it possible to do this easier?

--

##4. Where are the problems?

##5. There are even more problems?

# Primer on Quantile Regression

<br> 

- Introduced by `r Citet(myBib, "Koenker_1978")`

- Implemented in R in the `quantreg` package `r Citep(myBib, "Koenker_2020")`

- Fits conditional quantiles, rather than the conditional mean (OLS)

- Minimizes the sum of asymmetrically weighted residuals

- More robust against outliers than OLS

- Can handle skewed error distributions better than OLS

- Standard errors are somwehat less straightforward to calculate

--

## - Thus, it leaves roughly 5 % of the data below the line (when the 5 % quantile is fitted)

# How/Why to find the optimal number of dry days
.small2[
- <span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 160%'> <u> Question: </u> How long does it take for the soil to dry? </span>

- detailed physical knowledge of landslide location necessary

  - Evapotranspiration, Aspect, Slope, soil porosity, permeability, rainfall infiltration, ...

- "The practical background of ID is that [...] it .purple[could be] that precipitation information is a good proxy for both meteorological trigger and hydro- logical cause. Although applied in many case studies, this approach suffers from many false positives as well as .purple[limited physical process understanding]" `r Citep(myBib, "Bogaard_2018")`

- "[...] antecedent soil moisture conditions may provide .purple[critical support] for the correct definition of the triggering conditions." `r Citep(myBib, "Lazarri_2020")`

- "3-day recent rainfall and 15-day antecedent rainfall variables [12,20], are .purple[significantly improved] by merely replacing antecedent rainfall with average .purple[soil saturation measured over the same interval] `r Citep(myBib, "Mirus_2018")`
]

# 3-15 day 5 % non-exceedance antecedent thresholds

- 3 day precipitation prior to landslide (p3)

- 15 day precipitation prior to p3 (p15)

- Fit a 5 % non-exceedance probability threshold using quantile regression

- No need for defining "rainfall events"

- But where does the decision for the 3 and 15 days come from?

- Look at `r Citep(myBib, map_chr(c("_2000", "_2006", "_2008"), ~paste0("Chleborad", .x)))`

- Intuitive (mostly)

# Does this feel right?


## "separate the storms that lead to shallow landsliding from those that do not" `r Citep(myBib, "Jakob_2003")`
    
- Unusual in other common binary classification problems

- The model has no information whatsoever how rainfall events look like that (probably) did not cause landslides

- Probability to the rescue: "When different outputs (landslide or no-landslide) can be obtained for the same input a probabilistic approach is preferable" `r Citep(myBib, "Berti_2012")`
